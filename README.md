# Johto
This is the work-in-progress datapack for the Cobblemon port of my Minecraft adventure map [Pixelmon Johto](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/pixelmon-johto). Download the Cobbled version here:

This repo consists of all the functions and modded settings to make the map come alive, run its story, customize its features and environment meant to recreate the Pokemon games from Crystal and HGSS in Minecraft using the Cobblemon mod.

The best way to ask questions or chat about the project is through my Discord server. https://discord.gg/p5txVrp
